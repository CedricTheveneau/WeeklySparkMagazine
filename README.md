## Purpose

Weekly Spark Magazine is a personal project I created cause I'm a manga enthusiast who likes to write up stories.
The main goal is to centralize what I wrote in one single place so it's easier to find what you want to read and access it.
Another goal of this project is to show my skills and creativty as a whole, as well as creating yet another website to keep improving.

The main page will be composed of a carousel about the latest and most popular series on the website.
Right under it, you'll find the cards of the most recent updated/posted stories on the website. Those cards will feature an image, with some info about the chapter: the series it's from, its author, the date of publication, the chapter number and the sum up of the story up until that point.
When you will press on a card, it will pop-up so you can directly access the latest chapter's content without charging another page.
There will also be a recommended section, where you'll get some series or author recommended to you, based on what you've read.
Finally, you'll get an imbeded tweeter feed to keep track of the latest news related to the platform.

**please note that:**
- We're not selling anything, it's just a showcase website for our original work, we make it accessible to anyone.
- The website appearance may change from what's written here between now and its final version.

To make it simple: **This will be a manga publishing platform so I can share my creativity with the world.**

## Technologies

- **Bootstrap4** _for a quick and easy setup._

**Please note that:**
**I may need to use JS in the future to implement some functionalities**,_but for now, we're focusing on the V1.0 of the project so we'll see that later !_
